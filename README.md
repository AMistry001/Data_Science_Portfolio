# My Data Science Portfolio
Hi, everyone! This repository contains a multitude of data science and machine learning projects that I have completed. Many of these projects are related to data science courses and certificates I've completed in the past, mixed in with a few I completed just for fun. These projects are all created using Jupyter Notebooks, and are written entirely in Python 3. These projects are meant to be beginner-friendly and I've included the datasets I've used wherever possible in order for you to be able to follow along.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM):
> ### [Analyzing Seattle Accident Severity Data](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> > This is my capstone project for the 9-part IBM Professional Data Science Certificate track offered by Coursera. It centers around analyzing and predicting the severity of a vehicular accident in Seattle based on information such as time of day, date, road conditions, light conditions, weather conditions, and location. The project uses SVMs to parse and analyze the data, and also covers data cleaning, label-encoding, and feature selection. My full report of the project and findings can be found [here](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data.pdf).
   
## K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN):
> ### [Breast Cancer Classifier](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Breast%20Cancer%20KNN%20Classifier/K-Nearest-Neighbors%20Breast%20Cancer%20Classifier.ipynb):
> > This is a small project that I did as part of Codecademy's Data Science track. It uses a SciKitLearn dataset and a reiterating KNN machine learning algorithm to determine an optimal k-value that yields the highest accuracy in determining which tumors are benign and which are malignant and therefore indicative of breast cancer.

## Data Cleaning:
> ### [Data Cleaning with a Craigslist Automobile Dataset](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning%20with%20Craigslist%20Cars/Data%20Cleaning%20with%20a%20Craigslist%20Automobile%20Database.ipynb):
>> This project covers many fundamental data cleaning and data preprocessing techniques that are necessary in preparing a raw dataset before it can be used as input for a machine learning algorithm.
